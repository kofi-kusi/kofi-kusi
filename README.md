# Hi there! 👋 I'm Kofi Kusi Appau

### 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a passionate Computer Science student and aspiring Software Engineer with a knack for web development, blockchain technology, and problem-solving. Currently, I'm deepening my knowledge in full-stack development through **The Odin Project** and exploring **Web3** technologies through a bootcamp. I love building projects that challenge me and expand my technical skill set.

- 🌱 **Currently Learning**:  
  - Full-Stack Development with **The Odin Project**
  - **Web3** Development with a hands-on bootcamp ([HackerBoost](https://www.hackerboost.org/))

- 🎯 **Goal**: To build innovative solutions with code and contribute to open-source projects that can impact the world.

### 🚀 Projects
Here are a few projects I've worked on:

- **Learning Logs Web App** – A Django web app for tracking learning progress.
- **JavaScript Calculator** – A calculator app built with vanilla JavaScript.
- **Landing Page** – A responsive landing page showcasing design fundamentals.
- **Smart Contract Development** – Experimenting with Solidity in my project workspace ‘MyFirstSmartContract,’ where I created a `SimpleStorage.sol` file with arrays, structs, and enums.
